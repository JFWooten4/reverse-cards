## Meeting on 11 Jul 2023 at 3:30pm CT

There were approximately eight staff in attendance at an office conference table, including:
- [Jack Norman](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jack-norman-281088158/)
- [Michael Lanyon](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-lanyon-a3919a5/)
- [Hayden Middleton](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hayden-middleton-mba-838210156/)

I asked about their ACH credit and debit facilities, and they told me they believe the systems use BMO. While I was told that they would explicitly reply with a complete answer, I never heard back from these men.
